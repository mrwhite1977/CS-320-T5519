Software Test Automation &amp; QA

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  The first step to ensuring secure, functional code is educating myself on the tool, resources, and best practices available. Prior to this class, I had little knowledge of CI/CD tools. Now, I can use what I have learned here to develop my skills and expand my toolkit. Going forward, I plan to incorporate more testing into my development process. This includes adding more types of testing from static and dynamic to white box and black box.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
First, I read the requirements that have been presented to me and determine how I interpret them. If needed, I ask for clarification from the business stakeholder. I like to write out a roadmap using pseudocode. This helps me visualize what I am building so I can ensure all the requirements and features are included. Plus, I can work out step-by-step how I am going to fit everything together. Then, I start writing one component at a time based on the flow I developed. I can implement component and integration tests.

How do I approach designing software?
Looking back on the class, I learned the value of testing throughout the development process. The longer you wait the more difficult it can be to determine where your issues are. Reviewing the requirements periodically also helped me stay focused on what I needed to accomplish and occasionally gave me new insights to solve a challenge. I have several other techniques I like to use in designing software as well. I like to refer back to prior work that was successful and adapt that code to new projects, when applicable. I strive to test the component parts as I'm writing them and debug along the way. Usually, I will take a break anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour away from the project and focus on something completely different. This helps me clear my head and return to the project with better clarity.
